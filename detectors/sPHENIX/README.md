## Tracking QA at low occupancy

Low occupancy tracking QA concists full tracker + reconstruction of events with 20 $\pi^+$,  20 $\pi^-$ and one $\Upsilon(1S) \rightarrow e^+ e^-$. Please note the calorimeters are disabled to improve execution speed, which also removed some of the correlated albedo background for the tracker. 

The source code of the macro can be found at https://github.com/sPHENIX-Collaboration/macros/tree/QA-tracking-low-occupancy or [comparing it to the master branch](https://github.com/sPHENIX-Collaboration/macros/compare/QA-tracking-low-occupancy?expand=1).
